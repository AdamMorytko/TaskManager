# TaskManager
Simple console task manager written in Java. It was my first project during CodersLab.<br>
It uses CSV file to store the data.

#How it works
The application communicates with user to manage his tasks.<br>
The user can:<br>
* <b>ADD</b> - add a new task; its description, due date and its importance.
* <b>REMOVE</b> - delete a task.
* <b>LIST</b> - see an ordered list of tasks.
* <b>EXIT</b> - exit the application.<br>
Application updates the CSV file after each addition or deletion of a task.
